This project is part of a Python programming series focusing on data structures (lists and dictionaries) and loop control logic.

# [![Python application](https://github.com/dingonzo/python-loops-and-collections/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dingonzo/python-loops-and-collections/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

## Overview
The script `python-loops-and-collections.py` demonstrates how to:
- Navigate **multi-dimensional lists** (lists within lists).
- Iterate through **dictionaries** within a list to extract key-value pairs.
- Implement **While and For loops** with specific iteration counts and increments.

## Project Structure
- `python-loops-and-collections.py`: The main Python script containing the exercises and solutions.
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python ignore file to keep the repo clean.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the command: `python python-loops-and-collections.py`
